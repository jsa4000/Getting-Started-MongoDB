In this Repository I explain the basics of **How to get started in MongoDB**

>MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and is free and open-source, published under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License.

Any relational database like _Oracle_ or _MySQL_ has a typical schema design that shows number of tables and the relationship between these tables. While in MongoDB, there is no concept of **relationship.**

###Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS

- **Schema-less**. MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.

- Structure of a single object is clear.

- **No complex joins**.

- **Deep query-ability**. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL.

- Customizable and Tuning.

- **Ease of scale-out**.  MongoDB is easy to scale.

- Conversion/mapping of application objects to database objects not needed.

- Uses **internal memory** for storing the (windowed) **working set**, enabling faster access of data.

###Why Use MongoDB?

- Document Oriented Storage - Data is stored in the form of JSON style documents.

- Index on any attribute

- Replication and high availability

- Auto-sharding

- Rich queries

- Fast in-place updates

- Professional support by MongoDB
