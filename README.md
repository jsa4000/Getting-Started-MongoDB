In this Repository I explain the basics of **How to get started in MongoDB**

>MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and is free and open-source, published under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License.

Any relational database like _Oracle_ or _MySQL_ has a typical schema design that shows number of tables and the relationship between these tables. While in MongoDB, there is no concept of **relationship.**

###Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS

- **Schema-less**. MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.

- Structure of a single object is clear. **Indexes** can be applied on any attribute.

- **No complex joins**. **Rich queries**.

- **Deep query-ability**. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL.

- **Replication**, **high availability** and **Auto-sharding**. 

	>Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines.

- **Ease of scale-out**.  

- **Document Oriented Storage**. Data is stored in the form of JSON style documents so the mapping of application objects to database objects not needed. 

- Uses **internal memory** for storing the (windowed) **working set**, enabling faster access of data.
