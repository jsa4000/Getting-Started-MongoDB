#MongoDB for NodeJS

This example is a basic implementation that uses MongoDb and NodeJS. In this example I will use ExpressJS Framework too. Also, the project will be setup using **Visual Studio Code**.

There is **word** to define the Full-Stack of all these frameworks and technologies into one. This is called **MEAN** (MongoDB-ExpressJS-AngularJS-NodeJS) You can install directly by download the full package: https://meanjs.org/
There is the *npm* way to import those into your project directly. This is by typing the following command:
    
    npm install -g mean-cli
    mean init yourNewApp

MEAN stand for:

- **MongoDB** is the leading NoSQL database, empowering businesses to be more agile and scalable.
- **ExpressJ** is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.
- **AngularJS** lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
- **NodeJS** is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
